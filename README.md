3. To change the rotations of faces, open `rubikscube.py` in Visual Studio Code and follow the instructions at the bottom of the file.
4. To run, open a command prompt in the folder where rubikscube.py is stored and then run `python rubikscube.py`.

OR

1. Use an online compiler, such as https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/.

Reading the Rubik's Cube:
Each cell of an array contains a letter and number, which correspond to the colour and the position of that cell on a solved Rubik's Cube.
B3 would be the cell in the 1st row and 3rd column from the back face.
R5 would be the cell in the centre of the right face.
